Even though the flow of the text is altered, this is not actually changing the shape of the container.  Let's put a floated element inside a container and use some background colors to observe exactly what is happening.

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="floated">floated element</div>
  Contents of the container.
</div>
```
```css
.container {
  background-color
}

<!---
stacking floats horizontally
splitting floats in both direction
extending into another block-level
