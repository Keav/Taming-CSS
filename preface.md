# Taming CSS
# Preface

### "How do I learn CSS?"

I have been asked this question a lot.  For a long time, I was at a loss at how to answer it.  I knew CSS very well.  I had been using it for years, even decades, but I couldn't sum up a simple plan for learning CSS well.  At one point, I came up with a quick bullet list of items that tend to trip people up, then I could rattle those off.  It was something like, "Understand specificity, the box model, and floats".  But I never felt satisfied with that answer.

The truth is, there's more to it than that.  Yes, that bullet list represents some of the fundamentals you need to grasp in order to master CSS, but it always felt like I was giving a half-hearted answer.  There were still questions of code organization, essential pseudo-selector tricks, and other quirks of the language that seem only come with years of working through many issues in many different designs.

The thing that intrigues me most about this question is who asks it: it is almost always web developers.  People who work with the web every day.  People who, at least in my mind, already "know" CSS.

Occasionally, I ask what these people what they want to learn, and they always have a laundry list of little implementation details: "How do I get rid of this blue outline on an active button?"  "How do I make these borders line up like so?"  "I tried using inline block for this, but it didn't work."  Very rarely am I asked more general questions about the fundamentals behind these details.  This implies there's a disconnect.  We do not understand how the various principles of CSS connect; occasionally, we even may be missing certain principles entirely.

It is a lot like learning a natural language.  When you are truly fluent, you don't really have to think about the grammar rules; you just know what is right by feel.  But when you are learning a second language, you have to stop and think about how to say what you want to say.  You may run into difficulty because the idea you want to convey requires a complex verb structure you are not familiar with.  Other times, you simply may not know the word for an object.

There are a lot of things to learn in CSS.  Some are large topics, and require a lot of attention, like layout.  Others are small, standalone issues, like hex colors.  The problem is there is no clear path through them.  There are some great resources out there for learning most of these topics individually, but suprisingly few of them that put all the essentials together in one place.  There is no clear course map to learning CSS.  Often with CSS, you don't know what you don't know.  It is left up to the student of CSS to figure out what is next and then learn it.  This ultimately leads to failure, frustration, and animated gifs mocking the complexities of CSS.

This book is my attempt to fix that.  I hope that this becomes a coherent, comprehensive course map to learning CSS.  I won't pretend to teach you everything there is to know, but at the end of this course, you will have a firm grasp on essential pieces of the technology and how to wield them.

## How This Book is Structured

I think of CSS in four distinct topics: styling, layout, code organization, and developer tools, plus a few other odds and ends that don't fit cleanly into these four categories.  However, this book is not organized by topic.  Instead, we will cover things in order of importance.  We will first learn the most essential pieces of each.  Then we will layer on top more styling, a deeper understanding of layout, and so on.  Near the end of the book, we will tackle more advanced topics to flush out your toolset: stylistic rules of typography and color theory, transitions and animations, etc.

If you have already worked some with CSS, you will probably not need to start at the beginning.  Look at the chapter titles and skim the keywords in bold to make sure you are familiar with the concepts, and find the right place for you to start.  Because of the way I've structured this book, you should be able to find a good place to drop in regardless of your familiarity with CSS.

If you're a beginner, don't worry.  We'll start at the beginning.  Maybe your a back-end developer and you want to start understanding the front-end; maybe you don't know a thing about programming.  If so, don't worry.  This book is for you, too.

## CSS is Awesome

I love CSS.  I have been working with it since browsers first started supporting it in the mid-90s, and have enjoyed the explosion of new features we've seen in recent years with CSS3, as well as the wide array of novel approaches to code organization.

When developers joke about the difficulty of CSS or write it off as inscrutible, part of me shakes my head.  I understand their pain, because I've wrestled through it before.  And yes, there a few complex corners to wrap your head around.  But CSS isn't the problem; lack of understanding of CSS is the problem.  It is a widespread problem, and one we need to fix.
