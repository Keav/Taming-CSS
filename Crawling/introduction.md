# Taming CSS
# Section 1: Crawling

This book is primarily for web developers, but that doesn't necessarily mean experienced front-end developers.  Perhaps you are a back end developer, and want to begin to explore things on the front-end.  Or perhaps you are just starting out, and need to learn the basics.  If either of these is true, then this section will help you get started with CSS.  We'll cover syntax, basic styling, and a brief introduction to using your browser's developer tools.  We will also introduce several fundamental concepts of CSS:

 * The Cascade
 * Specificity
 * Inheritance
 * The Box Model
 * Document Flow

Understanding these is essential to becoming proficient in CSS.  Much of the rest of this book is built on the foundation of these concepts.  If you are already very familiar with them, feel free to skip ahead to *Section 2: Walking*.  If you are unsure, it may be worth your time to review; these are concepts that you will likely need to be revisit a few times before you have a complete understanding--You can skip to Chapter 3 where we will start on these fundamentals.

If you are new to CSS, however, welcome!  I'm glad you've decided to learn.  CSS is a daunting topic to many, but I don't think it has to be.  Together, we will walk through everything you need to know.  Commit to learning it--not just a cursory understanding, but a deep, working knowledge, and I think you'll do fine.  Follow along with the examples.  Replicate the code in your browser, and tinker with things to see what happens.  CSS is best learned through experience.  This book will walk you through the essentials, but seeing it in action on your screen will help you learn a lot faster.  And most of all, have fun!
